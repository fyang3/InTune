# Day 3 - Create Your Own Model with Teachable Machine 
![] https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/audio

## Design Your Own Model

## Playing with the Instrument Classifier
We've created a model using the Teachable Machine to identify over 10 instruments around the world!

## Comparing with human identifying and machine identifying instruments

## Questions to Reflect Upon
1. Describe what you think is going on inside of the model
2. What did the model learn?
3. What happens when we use 20 examples in each category versus 200 examples in each category?
4. Anyoneâ€™s model failed to classify sounds? Any thoughts on why?
5. If we want to break the model, how?
