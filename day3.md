4. Students will participate in a class discussion about A.I. Duet and present what they filled out on the chart (observations, reactions)
5. InTune will lead a small lesson on machine learning and how it was used to train the A.I duet program 


## Overall Assessment and Goals
Through the use of A.I. Piano Duet and Deep Drum & Deep Arp, we can provide student with context to the teachable machine. This way, students have an understanding of the possibilities of A.I. and how they could also be the creators. This can foster interest in technology and possibly produce future developers.
