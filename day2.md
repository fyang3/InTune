*   DEEP DRUM

*   DEEP ARP
* A.I. PIANO DUET

## Goals for Day 2

*   Computer-generated music
*   simplicity of (creating music via computer) it compared to creating a song with actual instruments
*   how you can create art (music) using various computer programs that are free 
*   ethics of creating computer-generated music

### Deep Drum and Deep Arp Activities

1. Log into computers (most likely Chromebooks) and press the link sent to them via email 
Experiment with Deep Drum for around 10-15 minutes producing a song of their own 

2. Students will present their songs (each group will have a turn)
After all groups have presented, students will vote for the group that has the best song/ beat

3. Groups will reflect on their experience (whether it was easy or difficult, what they think about the generator, would they rather learn instruments or create through a computerized matter, etc. 

### A.I. Piano Duet Activities

1. Students will press the link associated with A.I. Piano Duet and will wait for further instruction from InTune group
2. Before students begin experimenting. I will present the video on how to use A.I. The duet which also explains how it works (introduces concepts of machine learning)

3. Students will experiment with AI duet for about 5 minutes individually or in pairs)
They will fill out a chart with their observations and reactions

4. Students will participate in a class discussion about A.I. Duet and present what they filled out on the chart (observations, reactions)
5. InTune will lead a small lesson on machine learning and how it was used to train the A.I duet program
