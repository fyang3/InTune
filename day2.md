*   how you can create art (music) using various computer programs that are free 
*   ethics of creating computer-generated music

### Deep Drum and Deep Arp Activities

1. Log into computers (most likely Chromebooks) and press the link sent to them via email 
Experiment with Deep Drum for around 10-15 minutes producing a song of their own 

2. Students will present their songs (each group will have a turn)
After all groups have presented, students will vote for the group that has the best song/ beat

3. Groups will reflect on their experience (whether it was easy or difficult, what they think about the generator, would they rather learn instruments or create through a computerized matter, etc.
