# Day 1 - Organic Music with InTune
The goal of this activity is to introduce kids to the big concepts of AI and music production. It will be a good first-day activity not just as an introductory lesson, but it will also provide us with an assessment of our student’s knowledge of AI and music. This activity will also show kids that there is hard work involved in humans learning how to master an instrument unlike what it takes for a computer to generate music. They will also learn that although humans have to teach the computer how to generate music, computers are more efficient at handling large sets of musical data.


## Activity Breakdown
1. Each group assemble their own instruments and train the InTune models to let it recognize that

2. Students produce a small deliverable piece of music


3. Group/class discussion big ideas:
E.g hard work involved in humans’ hard work in learning how to master an instrument vs what it takes for a computer to generate music; the difference in a human-made instrument and computer-generated music in terms of characteristics
